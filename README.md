# Process
I’m a Pisces, I love swimming, and I’ve been obsessed with the ocean since my childhood. However, I was born at a place far away from the sea. I dream of living one day by the sea. Everything about the ocean such as sand, seagulls, shells, fish, fascinates me. It’s symbolizing a simple yet mysterious concept, just like the process of media and digital designing. 
# Challenges
With that in mind, I designed my website like the surface of the ocean, simple and pure. But under it, there may come the unexpected. Specifically, the website entails four parts: home, about, work, and contact. I tried to make the video take over the whole page, but unfortunately it somehow couldn’t. So I used an image with the similar color to cover the bottom part of the page. Also, some images had to be resized couple of times to really fit certain spot, which was easy but still annoying. What seemed the most overwhelming was the menu part. Since I had to use Bootstrap, the menu from which looked quite weirdly unbalanced and not very fit, I had to locate the key part and make some changes. If one place didn’t work, then I had to try another, until I found the correct place where the changes I wanted could be made. 
# What I’ve learnt
It is necessary to follow the prototype of the UX Design course, but that doesn’t mean that I have to make everything exactly the identical. Considering time and efficiency, certain compromises must be made. Also, keeping all the previous work/project in an organized way is essential, or I couldn’t have found what I wanted easily.
